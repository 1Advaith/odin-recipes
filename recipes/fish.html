            <li>1/4 c lime juice</li>

            <li>1 black pepper</li>

        <h3> Steps to Cook</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the lime juice, 1 tablespoon oil, ginger,
            cayenne pepper and enough freshly ground black pepper to suit your
            taste.</li> 
            
        <li>Marinate the fish in the marinade for 45-60 minutes. Turn
            steaks 2-3 times.</li> 
            
        <li>Have the grill prepared with white coals and
            brush the cooking grill with the remaining one tablespoon oil.</li> 
            
        <li>Grill the fish, brushing several times with the marinade, until
            cooked through and opaque in the center. Turn fish after about 4-5
            minutes. Total grilling time will dependon your grill and the heat of
            the coals.</li>
            * To broil instead, use a broiler pan brushed with oil and broil until
            center is opaque. Will take about 10 minutes total in broiler. Turn
            steaks after 5 minutes, and baste often with marinade.
